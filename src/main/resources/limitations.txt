Please be aware of the following limitations!

1. Stack sizes cannot exceed 64. In theory, it would be possible, but the client simply allows you to stack more
    than 64 items by clicking them.

2. Tools can currently not be stacked. Armor however, can.

3. If you use plugins that let you open shulkerboxes without placing them, you WILL encounter item loss if you make
    shulker boxes stackable. So: Only make them stackable if you do not use any of those plugins (e.g. ShulkerPacks)
