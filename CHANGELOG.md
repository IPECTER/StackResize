## 1.1.4
- Fixed a bug that prevented adding items into the "second slot of special inventories" (furnace fuel slot, enchanting table lapis lazuli slot, etc) if that slot already contained a stack of exactly one item
- Added Discord verification system. You do not have to verify your purchase, but you only get support on Discord if you have done so. The verification only takes a minute.
